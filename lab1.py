#1. Use the internet to find out what is the order of precedence for Python numeric operators.
#(), **, *, /, +, -

#2.What are the results of the following expressions? Use hand calculations with calculator.
# print(42/5)
# print(42//5)
# print(42 % 5)
# print(40 % 5)
# print(1 % 2)
# print(2 % 1)
# print(45 + 4 * 4 â€“ 2)
# print(45 + 43 % 5 * (23 * 3 % 2))
# print(5 ** 2)
# print(5.1 ** 2)

#3.Write the following expression in Python. Test your expression using python and print the answer.
4/3(r+34))-(9(a+bc) + ((3+d(2+a)/a+b))

#4.A company has determined that its annual profit is about 24 percent of total sales. Write a program
# that asks the user to enter the projected amount of total sales, then displays the profit that will be
# made from that amount.
annualProfit = .24
totalSales = float(input('Input total sales: '))
totalProfit = annualProfit*totalSales
print('Your total profit for this year is: ' + format(totalProfit, '.2f'))

#5. The distance a car travels down the road can be calculated with the formula:
# Distance = speed X time
time = float(input('Enter hours the car will travel?'))
distance = time * 85.00
print('The distance the car will travel in ' + format(time, '.2f') + ' hours is ' + format(distance, '.2f'))

#6The radius and mass of the Earth are r = 6378 X 103 meters and m1 = 5.9742 X 1024 kg, respectively.  Mr. Jones has a mass of X kg.  Prompt the user to input X and then calculate the gravitational force (F) and acceleration due to gravity (g) caused by gravitational force exerted on him by the Earth.
F =Gm1m/r2
F = mg
g = m/f

print('The resulting value of g is ' + )
