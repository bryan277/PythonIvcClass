#input/output
#Typically 3 steps in writing a program
#1-input (eating)
#2-processing
#3-output (shiting)

#Output
#use print() function
#>>>print('hello world')
#Both single or double quotes can be used

#Strings and strings literal
#each piece of letter is caleed a character
#a sequence of character makes a string
#string literal - when a string appears in the actual code of a program


#Read "Hamlet" from shakespare
#print('Read "Hamlet" from shakespare')

#I'm reading "Hamlet" tonight
#print('''I'm reading "Hamlet" tonight''')
#print("""I'm reading "Hamlet" tonight""")
#Comments
#-notes for humans, Python ignores them
    #This program
    #is written by___

#Escape Sequence with Strings
#allows you to put special characters in Strings
#\t   tab   print("\t\t\Fancy Candy")  >>>___ ____ ___Fancy Candy
#\n   newline  print("her is a string\n")  >>> here is a strings
#\a   bell   print("\a") makes a bell noise
#\'   prints a single quote
#\"   prints a double quote

#Henry 'The Great' is not that great!
#print('Henry \'The Great\' is not that great!')
#print("Henry \"The Great\" is not that great!")
#print("3\\2")

#Concatenating strings
#means to join
#Long live the King
#print("Long live the King" + "Don't forget the Queen")
#>>>Long live the KingDon't forget the Queen

#Repeating Strings
#print("pie" * 6)

#Write a program to calculate the sum of 3 numbers
#1 Values(input)
# 10  20  30
#2 10 + 20 + 30 = 60
# 60/3

#1.input
#a = 10
#b = 20
#c = 30

#2.Processing
#sum= a + b + c
#avg = sum/3

#3.Output
#print(sum)
#print(avg)

##student name
##student ID
##program to calculate sum and avg

##input
#a = 10
#b = 20
# c = 30

#Processing
# sum = a + b + c
# avg = sum/3

# #Output
# print("The sum is", sum)
# print("The average is", avg)
